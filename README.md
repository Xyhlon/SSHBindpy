# SSHBindpy Python Wrapper

**SSHBindpy** is a Python wrapper for the [SSHBind](https://github.com/Xyhlon/SSHBind)
Rust library. It provides a Pythonic interface to bind remote services—located behind
multiple SSH jump hosts—to a local socket. The package exports a single context manager:
**SSHBinding**.

## Features

- **Single Public API:** Only the `SSHBinding` context manager is exposed. All internal
  functionality (i.e. the underlying `bind` and `unbind` functions) is hidden.
- **Automatic Resource Management:** The context manager binds a remote service upon
  entering the context and unbinds it upon exit.
- **Secure Credential Handling:** Uses SOPS-encrypted YAML files for secure and
  reproducible credential management.
- **Rust-Powered Efficiency:** Leverages the performance and reliability of the SSHBind
  Rust library.

## System Requirements

Before using SSHBindpy, ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- **OpenSSL:** Provides necessary cryptographic functions.
- **SOPS:** Required for decrypting encrypted YAML credential files.
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or later.
- **Rust Toolchain (Optional):** Necessary for building the Rust extension (install via
  [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
- **Nix/direnv (Optional):** For reproducible development environments.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install sshbind
```

### From Source Using Maturin

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Xyhlon/SSHBindpy.git
   cd SSHBindpy
   ```

1. **Build the Package:**

   With maturin:

   ```bash
   maturin build --release
   ```

   Or using Nix:

   ```bash
   nix build
   ```

1. **Install the Built Wheel:**

   Locate the wheel in the `target/wheels/` directory and install it:

   ```bash
   pip install target/wheels/sshbind-*.whl
   ```

## Usage

sshbind exports a single context manager: `SSHBinding`. Use it to bind a remote service
to a local socket. The context manager automatically calls the underlying Rust functions
to bind on entry and unbind on exit.

```python
from sshbind import SSHBinding

with SSHBinding("127.0.0.1:8000", ["jump1:22", "jump2:22"], "remote.service:80", "secrets.yaml") as binding:
    # Use the bound service within this block.
    # The remote service is bound when entering the context,
    # and unbound automatically when exiting.
    pass
```

## Development

### Using Nix or direnv

For a reproducible development environment, you can use either Nix or direnv.

- **With Nix:**

  ```bash
  nix develop
  ```

  This command opens a shell with all necessary dependencies (Rust toolchain, OpenSSL,
  SOPS, etc.) preconfigured.

- **With direnv:** Create a `.envrc` file containing your environment variables and run:

  ```bash
  direnv allow
  ```

### Without Nix

If you choose not to use Nix, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust Toolchain:** Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- **OpenSSL:** Install using your system’s package manager.
- **SOPS:** Install from your package manager or
  [from source](https://github.com/mozilla/sops).
- **Maturin:** Install with pip:
  ```bash
  pip install maturin
  ```

Then build the package as described above.

## Building and Publishing

### Building the Package

- **With Nix:**
  ```bash
  nix build
  ```
- **With Maturin:**
  ```bash
  maturin build --release
  ```

### Publishing the Package

Tag a commit and the CI will publish it.

## Developer Dependencies

- **Maturin:** Build backend for compiling the Python extension.
- **Rust Toolchain:** For compiling the underlying Rust code.
- **Nix/direnv (Optional):** For reproducible development environments.
- **Python 3.8+:** The minimum supported Python version.
